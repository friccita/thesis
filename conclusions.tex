\chapter{Conclusions\label{sec:conclusions}}

A search for the decay $H\rightarrow$$aa/hh\rightarrow4\tau$ was performed in the gluon fusion, $W$ associated, $Z$ associated, and vector boson fusion production modes.  No evidence of this exotic decay was found, and upper limits on the branching ratio to new physics, assuming SM production of the 125 GeV Higgs, were set.  For a 9 GeV pseudoscalar, an upper limit of 19\% was set on $BR(\PH\to4\tau)$. This result is the first of its kind at the LHC.
