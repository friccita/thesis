\abstract{This thesis presents a search for non-standard decays of a Standard Model-like Higgs boson to pairs of light bosons, as predicted in models with extended Higgs sectors. In two Higgs doublet models, including the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model, the Higgs boson can decay into a pair of light scalars $h$ or pseudoscalars $a$.  In this search, the gluon fusion, $W$ and $Z$ associated Higgs, and vector boson fusion production channels for the Higgs are all considered, and the decay $H\rightarrow$$aa(hh)$ with $a(h)\rightarrow\tau\tau$ is reconstructed from the tau decay products. The final state is characterized by one isolated high $p_T$ muon plus at least one highly boosted pair of taus, of which one of the taus is required to decay to a muon. Using 19.7 fb$^{-1}$ of 8 TeV center of mass $pp$ collision data recorded by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, a counting experiment is performed in a region of high di-tau invariant mass. No excess of events above the Standard Model backgrounds has been found, and the observed data is used to set upper limits on the branching ratio Br($H\rightarrow$$aa/hh$)Br$^{2}(a/h\rightarrow\tau\tau)$.}

\acknowledgments{Acknowledgements to those who helped you get to this point. They should be listed by chapter when appropriate.}
%I would like to thank my graduate advisor, Maxwell Chertok, for all his patient help, advice, and friendship during my development as a high-energy physics researcher; and also Robin Erbacher and Michael Mulhearn for serving on my thesis committee. My appreciation extends to the rest of the UC Davis CMS group as well, for their welcoming and supportive working atmosphere.
%During my years at CERN, I have learned a lot from working with my colleagues. There was Rachel Yohay, whose mentorship taught me so much about physics analysis techniques and CMS software as we worked together on what was to be my thesis research. Mauro Dinardo, Martina Malberti, and Gino Bolla all patiently gave me their expert advice and answered my questions as we worked with the CMS forward pixel detector. I am grateful to Dan Duggan and Gaelle Boudoul for teaching me about pixel offline software, Petra Merkel and Yana Osborne for getting me started in my first pixel geometry simulation project, and Viktor Veszpr\'{e}mi for his guidance during my tracker material budget group convenership.
%I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to many of the friends that I have met along my path -- to name a few: Valentina and Yuliya Prilepina, Roxanne Moran, C\'{e}cile Caillol, Andrzej \.{Z}ura\'{n}ski, Xiaohang Quan, Mahboobeh Yarmohammadi Satri, Ping Yang, Juliana Froggatt, Aurelijus Rinkevicius, Judita Mamuzic, Christine McLean, and Nataliia Kondrashova. I would like to give special thanks to Fanbo Meng, whose emotional support and friendship have been precious in helping me to learn about myself and grow as a person.
%Most of all, my family has shaped me personally and intellectually into who I am now, and the appreciation that I express to them can never be adequate. I dedicate this thesis to all of them. To Pap\`{a}, who has always taught me to have confidence in my own intellect and logic, and who proved to me that the mind of a physicist can tackle anything. To Mammina, who has encouraged my fascination with nature and my interest in reading and art. To my sisters Daniela and Chiara, who have constantly given me inspiration with their boldness, creativity, and curiosity as we grew up together.
