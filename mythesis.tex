\acknowledgments{Acknowledgements to those who helped you get to this point. They should be listed by chapter when appropriate.}
%Family: Papˆ for teaching me calculus, physics, piano, French, and Italian, encouraging me to develop my own strength and teach myself, and proving to me that the mind of a physicist can tackle anything. Mammina for fostering my fascination with nature and my interest in art and reading. Daniela and Chiara for inspiring me with their boldness and creativity to explore new things as we grew up together.
%Advisor: Maxwell Chertok for his patience, help, and friendship in my development as a researcher. For answering my questions and giving advice. And additionally, thanks to the UCD CMS group for their welcoming and supportive atmosphere.
%Colleagues and friends: Rachel Yohay, whose mentorship taught me so much about physics analysis techniques and CMS software as we worked on this my thesis research together. Gino Bolla, Mauro Dinardo, and Martina Malberti for their expert advice during my hardware work on the forward pixel detector. Dan Duggan for introducing me to pixel offline software, Petra Merkel for finding me my first project in pixel geometry simulation, Viktor Veszpr\'{e}mi for his advice and support during my tracker DPG subgroup convenership. Thanks for the companionship of the friends that I have made all along the way -- in particular: Valentina and Yuliya Prilepina, Roxanne Moran, Mahboobeh Yarmohammadi Satri, Andrzej \.{Z}ura\'{n}ski, Xiaohang Quan, C\'{e}cile Caillol, Ping Yang, Juliana Froggatt, Aurelijus Rinkevicius, Christine McLean, Judita Mamuzic, and Nataliia Kondrashova -- whose companionship helped me to relax and stay afloat during my studies and research. Finally, special thanks to my fianc\'{e} Fanbo Meng, whom I was so lucky to meet at CERN, for his constant love and support.

\UMIabstract[The abstract that is submitted to UMI must be formatted as shown in the example here. The body of the abstract cannot exceed 350 words. It should be in typewritten form, double-spaced, and on bond paper. It is important to write an abstract that gives a clear description of the content and major divisions of the dissertation, since UMI will publish the abstract exactly as submitted. Students completing their requirements under Plan A should provide extra copies of the typed summary for use by the dissertation committee during the examination.
