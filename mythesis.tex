\abstract{This thesis presents a search for non-standard decays of a Standard Model-like Higgs boson to pairs of light bosons, as predicted in models with extended Higgs sectors. In two Higgs doublet models, including the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model, the Higgs boson can decay into a pair of light scalars $h$ or pseudoscalars $a$.  In this search, the gluon fusion, $W$ and $Z$ associated Higgs, and vector boson fusion production channels for the Higgs are all considered, and the decay $H\rightarrow$$aa(hh)$ with $a(h)\rightarrow\tau\tau$ is reconstructed from the tau decay products. The final state is characterized by one isolated high $p_T$ muon plus at least one highly boosted pair of taus, of which one of the taus is required to decay to a muon. Using 19.7 fb$^{-1}$ of 8 TeV center of mass $pp$ collision data recorded by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, a counting experiment is performed in a region of high di-tau invariant mass. No excess of events above the Standard Model backgrounds has been found, and the observed data is used to set upper limits on the branching ratio Br($H\rightarrow$$aa/hh$)Br$^{2}(a/h\rightarrow\tau\tau)$.}

\acknowledgments{Acknowledgements to those who helped you get to this point. They should be listed by chapter when appropriate.}
%I would like to thank my graduate advisor, Maxwell Chertok, for all his patient help, advice, and friendship during my development as a high-energy physics researcher, and also Robin Erbacher and Michael Mulhearn for serving on my thesis committee. My appreciation extends to the rest of the UC Davis CMS group as well, for their welcoming and supportive working atmosphere.
%During my years at CERN, I have worked with many colleagues and learned a lot from them. The list is so long that I cannot mention them all, but I would like to thank a few in particular here. There was Rachel Yohay, whose mentorship taught me so much about physics analysis techniques and CMS software as we worked together on this physics analysis that was my thesis research. Gino Bolla, Mauro Dinardo, and Martina Malberti all patiently gave me their expert advice and answered my questions as I helped to repair and calibrate the CMS forward pixel detector. I am grateful to Dan Duggan and Gaelle Boudoul for teaching me about pixel offline software, Petra Merkel for finding me my first project in pixel geometry simulation, and Viktor Veszpr\'{e}mi for his advice and support during my tracker material budget convenership. I also want to thank all the friends that I have made along the way -- in particular: Valentina and Yuliya Prilepina, Roxanne Moran, Mahboobeh Yarmohammadi Satri, Andrzej \.{Z}ura\'{n}ski, Xiaohang Quan, C\'{e}cile Caillol, Ping Yang, Juliana Froggatt, Aurelijus Rinkevicius, Christine McLean, Judita Mamuzic, and Nataliia Kondrashova -- whose friendship has been invaluable in helping me to relax and keep my balance during my studies and research.
%Last but not least, I am very grateful to my family for their love and support, and for shaping me into who I am. Pap\`{a} has taught me calculus, physics, music, French, and Italian; always encouraged me to develop confidence in my own intellect; and proved to me that the mind of a physicist can tackle anything. Mammina has encouraged my fascination with nature and my interest in reading and art. My younger sisters Daniela and Chiara, with their boldness, creativity, and curiosity, have inspired me to follow their example as we grew up together. And I am very grateful to my fianc\'{e} Fanbo Meng, whom I was so lucky to meet at CERN, for his constant love and encouragement.
