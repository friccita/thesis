\abstract{In this dissertation, I present a search for non-standard decays of a Standard Model-like Higgs boson to pairs of light bosons, as predicted in models with extended Higgs sectors. In two Higgs doublet models, including the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model, the Higgs boson can decay into a pair of light pseudoscalars $a$.  In this search, the gluon fusion, $W$ and $Z$ associated Higgs, and vector boson fusion production channels for the Higgs are all considered, and the decay $H\rightarrow$$aa$ with $a\rightarrow\tau\tau$ is reconstructed from the tau decay products. The final state is characterized by one isolated high $p_T$ muon plus at least one highly boosted pair of taus, of which one of the taus is required to decay to a muon. Using 19.7 fb$^{-1}$ of 8 TeV center of mass $pp$ collision data recorded by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, a counting experiment is performed in a region of high di-tau invariant mass. We have found no excess of events above the Standard Model backgrounds, and the observed data is used to set upper limits on the branching ratio Br($H\rightarrow$$aa$)Br$^{2}(a\rightarrow\tau\tau)$. These results are equally applicable to decays of the SM-like Higgs boson to a pair of light scalars $h$.}

\acknowledgments{I would like to thank my graduate advisor, Maxwell Chertok, for his patient help, advice, and friendship during my development as a high-energy physics researcher; and also Robin Erbacher and Michael Mulhearn for serving on my thesis committee. My appreciation extends to the rest of the UC Davis CMS group as well, for their welcoming and supportive working atmosphere.

During my years at CERN, I have learned a lot from working with my colleagues. There was Rachel Yohay, whose mentorship taught me much of what I know about data analysis techniques and CMS software as we worked together on what was to be my thesis research. Mauro Dinardo, Martina Malberti, and Gino Bolla all patiently gave me their expert advice and answered my questions during my hardware work with the CMS forward pixel detector. I am grateful to Dan Duggan and Gaelle Boudoul for teaching me about pixel offline software, Petra Merkel and Yana Osborne for getting me started in my first pixel geometry simulation project, and Viktor Veszpr\'{e}mi for his guidance during my tracker material budget group convenership.

I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to the friends that I have met along my path, who are too many to name here. And finally, I dedicate this thesis to my family. -- To my father, who has always taught me to have confidence in my own intellect and logic, and who proved to me that the mind of a physicist can tackle anything. To my mother, who has encouraged my interest in reading and the study of nature. To my sisters, who have constantly given me inspiration with their boldness, creativity, and curiosity as we grew up together.}

\preface{Elementary particle physics is the study of the most fundamental components of matter: determining what these components are, and how they behave. The word ``atom" is derived from the ancient Greek word for ``indivisible"; the discovery that atoms are not in fact indivisible but are themselves made up of smaller components -- electrons, protons, and neutrons -- set the stage for the ongoing search for ever-smaller and more fundamental building blocks of matter.

Decades of research have culminated in the present day with the Standard Model of fundamental physics. The search for the Higgs boson, the last major puzzle piece of the Standard model, carried on for many years,  The most recent validation of the Standard Model was the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, which resolved the longstanding paradox of electroweak gauge boson masses. I feel fortunate to have started my work at CERN just at that exciting time when the Higgs boson discovery was announced, and when much work still lay ahead to uncover what lies beyond the Standard Model.

Various theories of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) have been developed, and they involve many unknown and interdependent parameters. Just as the Higgs boson mass was once unknown and had to be narrowed down by years of experimental research and data analysis, the parameters of BSM physics theories are still in the process of being increasingly constrained by experimental data, but there is a wide possible range of values open to them. This means that many different models of BSM physics, based on different combinations of assumptions for these parameters, still remain to be experimentally tested.

The collaboration of thousands of researchers at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) are currently engaged in analyzing data from the Large Hadron Collider for signals of processes predicted by the many models of BSM physics that there are. The research done for this dissertation has been part of that effort -- my little contribution to our collective chipping-away at the unknown, inching towards a clearer picture of fundamental physics.}
