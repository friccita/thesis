\UMIabstract[The abstract that is submitted to UMI must be formatted as shown in the example here. The body of the abstract cannot exceed 350 words. It should be in typewritten form, double-spaced, and on bond paper. It is important to write an abstract that gives a clear description of the content and major divisions of the dissertation, since UMI will publish the abstract exactly as submitted. Students completing their requirements under Plan A should provide extra copies of the typed summary for use by the dissertation committee during the examination.
